Inquiry regarding the collection of insurance data


I would like to kindly request clarification and confirmation regarding the collection of data for two insurers operating with an internal model in Poland: Hestia and InterRisk.

Both companies belong to international groups, and I would like to ensure whether, as the Polish supervisory authority, we should collect this data directly from these insurers in our market. Or will this data be provided to you at the group level, meaning that we do not need to collect it from these entities ourselves?

I would greatly appreciate your confirmation and clarification on this matter.

Best regards,

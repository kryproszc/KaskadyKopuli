Good morning,
Referring to the conversation about internal models in Poland.
In Poland, we have two companies: Interrisk, which has a partial internal model, and Ergo Hestia, which has a full internal model.

Interrisk has now reported a change in the main model, which is planned to be implemented by the end of the year, so we are not submitting Interrisk for review.

As for Ergo Hestia, is it being submitted as a group? The internal model of Ergo Hestia in Poland is aligned with the model for the entire group. Therefore, we are wondering whether to submit Ergo Hestia as a company operating only in Poland.
